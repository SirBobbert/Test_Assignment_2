  ### 1.2 Catastrophic Failure
   In the coastal town of Lums√•s in 1982, a fateful missile launch incident occurred due to a software glitch. This event serves as a reminder of the vital role software systems play in our modern world and the potential repercussions of software errors. The Danish Navy's frigate "Peder Skram" was preparing for a NATO exercise at sea. Inexplicably, during a routine missile test, a software malfunction triggered the accidental launch of a 600-kilogram Harpoon missile. The missile's erratic trajectory spared lives but left behind a trail of destruction among unoccupied holiday homes. This incident remains a testament to the need for rigorous software testing and the safeguarding of critical systems against unforeseen software errors.

  Given that this incident was due to a glitch, a simulation test with safety overrides could have been employed as a preventive measure. Prior to any live missile test, a comprehensive simulation scenario could have been created. This scenario should mimic the conditions of a missile launch, including all relevant parameters, coordinates, and inputs.

  A simulation test, in short, is designed to assess how one would react to situations encountered while working and how one would solve problems.
